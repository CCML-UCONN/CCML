Welcome to the Github website for Computational Catalysis and Materials (CCM) group at UCONN.

Research in the CCM group is mostly done using the [Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)](https://www.vasp.at) and [Quantum ESPRESSO (QE)](http://github.com/vossjo/ase-espresso). We also use [Atomic Simulation Environment](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) and other tools to visualize, manipulate and post-process calculations. Computing resources in the CCM group are provided by [UCONN's HPC facility on the Storrs campus](https://hpc.uconn.edu/storrs/) and [Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC)](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu)'s [Stampede system](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/stampede). 

This website provides useful instructions and resources for research in our group, including but not limited to:

1. Setting up accounts on high performance computing (HPC) clusters.
2. Tutorials for UNIX command lines and Python.
3. Running Jobs on clusters.
4. Resources.
5. Codes developed in the CCM group.
