Welcome to the Github website for Computational Catalysis and Materials (CCM) group at UCONN.

### Overview ###
Research in the CCM group is mostly done using the [Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)](https://www.vasp.at) and [Quantum ESPRESSO (QE)](http://github.com/vossjo/ase-espresso). We also use [Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) and other tools to visualize, manipulate and post-process calculations. Computing resources in the CCM group are provided by [UCONN's HPC facility on the Storrs campus](https://hpc.uconn.edu/storrs/) and [Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC)](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu)'s [Stampede system](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/stampede).


This website provides useful instructions and resources for research in our group, including but not limited to:
