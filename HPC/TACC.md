# Running Jobs on TACC
Most of our jobs require dedication of multiple nodes. Therefore jobs cannot be executed on the front node(the node everyone interfaces when logged onto the cluster). The HPC cluster use a job management system to process the resource requirements and its distribution to working/slave nodes. Some more useful information about the batch system on HPC-Storrs can be found [here]()

You can find several different job submission scripts in the following directory:
`$GRPDIR/share/example/scripts/batch`

Pick the one meets your need most and edit the corresponding fields.



Once you account on Stampede has been activated. Follow the instructions and tests to make sure everything is set up properly and functional.

## Installation

### Mac OSX
Download and install:

* [XQuartz](http://www.xquartz.org/)

To prevent X11 from timing out, open the terminal and type:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
echo $'\nHost *\n ForwardX11Timeout 1000000\n' >>~/.ssh/config
```


### Windows

Download and install:

* [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/)
* [Xming](http://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/) (Note: disable automatic installation of PuTTY with Xming. The above installer is a newer version)


### Linux (Debian-based, e.g. Ubuntu)
From the terminal

## Logging onto the Clusters

For the [**Stampede**](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/stampede/) cluster, make sure to read through the User Guide [here](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/stampede).

login with your Stampede username (most probably start with ```tgxxxxxx```, check your account [here](https://www.xsede.org/group/xup/accounts))and password (you will aslo be asked for Mulit-factor Authorization).

Follow the instructions below for your system:

### Mac OSX

Open "Applications-> Utilities -> Terminal" or "Command+Space" to search Terminal using "spotlight search"
In a terminal:
```bash
ssh -X username@stampede.tacc.utexas.edu
```

### Windows
Launch Xming. You will always need to have this open in order to forward graphical windows from the external clusters.

Start PuTTY, and:

* “Session” → “Host Name” `username@stampede.tacc.utexas.edu` for **Stampede**
* “Connection” → “SSH” → “X11” check “Enable X11 forwarding”
* Back in “Session”, you can **save these settings for next time**.

You can start putty several times, if you need several terminal windows; only one instance of Xming needed.


### Linux ###

In a terminal:
```bash
ssh -X username@stampede.tacc.utexas.edu
```

### First Time Logging in ###

For the **first login** only, run the following command:

```bash
cp /home1/03672/tg829713/vojgroup/bash_script/bashrc_copy ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

This will enable you to run specific software on the Stampede cluster, including the ASE interface to Quantum ESPRESSO.

There are two file partitions, the `home` and the `work` partition. Go ahead and make a symbolic link to the `work` partition using:

```bash
ln -s $WORK work
```

**Change the permission of files:**

```bash
cd
cd work
mkdir CBE544
chmod g+X $WORK
chgrp -R G-818582 CBE544
chmod g+s CBE544
chmod g+rX CBE544
```

**Perform all your calculations from the work/CBE544**

For example, Create a folder `hw5` under `CBE544` and perform all calculations of HW5 in `hw5`. If you have already started you jobs somewhere else, you can copy the entire folder to CBE544 once you have done all calculations (e.g. `cp -r folderpath ~/work/CBE544/hw5`).  However, you need to complete this step before sending us the report of HW5, and please include the path of `CBE544` folder in your report or email. You can obtain the path by

```bash
cdw
cd CBE544
pwd
```

## Making Sure Everything Works ##

Once you are logged into the terminal, run:

```bash
ase-gui
```

and make sure a graphical interface appears. Next, run Python in interactive mode by typing:

```bash
python
```

and make sure the following commands work:

```python
import ase
import numpy
```
